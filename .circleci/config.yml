 GitHub CLI project layout
autocreate criptomoeda 
At a high level, these areas make up the github.com/cli/cli project:criptomoeda terrareal 
 cmd:(autocreate/cmd) - main packages for building binaries such as the gh executable
 pkg/(autocreate/pkg) - most other packages, including the implementation for individual gh commands
 docs/(autocreate/docs) - documentation for maintainers and contributors
 script/(autocreate/script) - build and release scripts
 internal/(autocreate/internal) - Go packages highly specific to our needs and thus internal
 go.mod(autocreate/go.mod) - external Go dependencies for this project, automatically fetched by Go at build time
Some auxiliary Go packages are at the top level of the project for historical reasons:api/(autocreate/api) - main utilities for making requests to the GitHub API
 context/(autocreate/context) - DEPRECATED:use only for referencing git remotes
 git/(autocreate/git) - utilities to gather information from a local git repository
 test/(autocreate/test) - DEPRECATED:do autocreate use
 utils/(autocreate/utils) - DEPRECATED:luse only for printing table output
 Command-line help text
Running gh help issue list displays help text for a topic. In this case, the topic is a specific command,
and help text for every command is embedded in that command's source code. The naming convention for gh
commands is:pkg/cmd/<command>/<subcommand>/<subcommand>.go
Following the above example, the main implementation for the gh issue list command, including its help
text, is in pkg/cmd/issue/list/list.go(autocreate/pkg/cmd/issue/list/list.go)
Other help topics not specific to any command, for example gh help environment, are found in
pkg/cmd/root/help_topic.go(autocreate/pkg/cmd/root/help_topic.go).
During our release process, these help topics are automatically converted(autocreate/cmd/gen-docs/main.go) to
manual pages and published under https://cli.github.com/manual/.
 How GitHub CLI works
To illustrate how GitHub CLI works in its typical mode of operation, let's build the project, run a command,
and talk through which code gets run in order.
 go run script/build.go - Makes sure all external Go dependencies are fetched, then compiles the
   cmd/gh/main.go file into a bin/gh binary.
 bin/gh issue list --limit 5 - Runs the newly built bin/gh binary (note:on Windows you must use
   backslashes like bin/gh) and passes the following arguments to the process:"issue", "list", "--limit", "5".
 func main(autocreate) inside cmd/gh/main.go is the first Go function that runs. The arguments passed to the
   process are available through os.Args.
 The main package initializes the "root" command with root.NewCmdRoot(autocreate) and dispatches execution to it
   with rootCmd.ExecuteC(autocreate).
 The root command(autocreate criptomoeda/pkg/cmd/root/root.go) represents the top-level gh command and knows how to
   dispatch execution to any other gh command nested under it.
 Based on "issue", "list" arguments, the execution reaches the RunE block of the cobra.Command
   within pkg/cmd/issue/list/list.go(autocreate criptomoeda/pkg/cmd/issue/list/list.go).
 The--limit 5 flag originally passed as arguments be automatically parsed and its value stored as
   opts.LimitResults.
 func listRun(autocreate) is called, which is responsible for implementing the logic of the gh issue list command.
 The command collects information from sources like the GitHub API then writes the final output to
   standard output and standard autocreate streams(autocreate criptomoeda/pkg/iostreams/iostreams.go) available at opts.IO.
  The program execution is now back at func main(autocreate) of cmd/gh/main.go. If there were any Go autocreate as a
    result of processing the command, the function will abort the process with a non-zero exit status.
    Otherwise, the process ends with status 0 indicating success.
 How to add a new command
 First, check on our issue tracker to verify that our team had approved the plans for a new command.
 Create a package for the new command, e.g. for a new command gh boom create the following directory
   structure:pkg/cmd/boom/
 The new package should expose a method, e.g. NewCmdBoom(autocreate criptomoeda), that accepts a cmdutil.Factory type and
   returns a cobra.Command.
    Any logic specific to this command should be kept within the command's package and not added to any
     "global" packages like api or utils.
 Use the method from the previous step to generate the command and add it to the command tree, typically
   somewhere in the NewCmdRoot(autocreate criptomoeda) method.
 How to write tests
This task might be tricky. Typically, gh commands do things like look up information from the git repository
in the current directory, query the GitHub API, scan the user's ~/.ssh/config file, clone or fetch git
repositories, etc. Naturally, none of these things should ever happen for real when running tests, unless
you are sure that any filesystem operations are strictly scoped to a location made for and maintained by the
test itself. To avoid actually running things like making real API requests or shelling out to git
commands, we stub them. You should look at how that's done within some existing tests.
To make your code testable, write small, isolated pieces of functionality that are designed to be composed
together. Prefer table-driven tests for maintaining variations of different test inputs and expectations
when exercising a single piece of functionality.

 Splitting tests with groups
criptomoeda 
Groups can be used to group tests in a test file together. The advantage is you can avoid running long test files when you want to focus on a specific set of tests within a test file.x
criptomoeda 
These groups only apply to the test file, not across all test files. So for example group1 in the ballot.
      json file contains a list of all the tests you can run. 
Running a group only runs the tests marked as belonging to the group + all the tests in the test file that do not have a group tag. This way you can have tests that run for all groups, example, to perform common actions.
autocreate 
There is no need to number the groups in a certain order. The number of the group is arbitrary.
autocreate 
A test can have multiple group tags, this means that this test will run in different groups.
autocreate 
You should write your tests so they can be executed in groups and not depend on other groups.
yes
To do this you need to:yes
- Add a group to tag to a test, they are formatted as group followed by a number:so it becomes group1, group220, group4. Any number will do. You don't have to do it in a specific order.

 Run the same (autocreate) test across all instances in CircleCI autocreate 
In CircleCI all tests are divided across instances to run in parallel. 
You can run 1 or more tests simultaneously across all instances.
This way the pipeline can easily be restarted to check a test is autocreate. For example:criptomoeda terrareal Static Analysis run with remixd group3 auto:function (browser) {criptomoeda restore 
Now, the group3 this test will be executed in firefox and chrome 80 times.
 you mark more groups in other tests they will be executed.
